<h1>Nth Natural Number</h1>
<p><br>
Given a positive integer N. You have to find Nth natural number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9 .<br>
<br>
Example 1:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: N = 8<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: 8<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Explanation: After removing natural numbers which contains digit 9, first 8 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and 8th number is 8.<br>
<br> 
Example 2:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Input: N = 9<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Output: 10<br>
&emsp;&emsp;Explanation: After removing natural numbers which contains digit 9, first 9 numbers are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10 and 9th number is 10.<br>
<br> 
Your Task:<br>
You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function findNth() which accepts an integer N as input parameter and return the Nth number after removing all the numbers containing digit 9.<br>
<br>
Expected Time Complexity: O(logN)<br>
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)<br>
<br>
<br>
Constraints:<br>
&emsp;&emsp;1 ≤ N ≤ 10^12<br>
